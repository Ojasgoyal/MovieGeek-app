## Design Choices

### Why Flask and SQLite3?
Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, which allowed for rapid development of the web app. It is perfect for small to medium-sized applications like this, where the use of a more complex framework like Django would be unnecessary. SQLite3 was selected as the database due to its lightweight nature and the fact that this project does not require a high-traffic solution.

### Why TMDB API?
The TMDB API provides access to an extensive and well-organized database of movies, TV shows, and people. It offers detailed metadata, including ratings, cast and crew details, images, and trailers, making it an ideal choice for the project's needs.

### User Interface Design
The design is minimalist and user-friendly, using Bootstrap for responsive design and custom CSS to enhance the user experience. The application is designed to be intuitive, with clear navigation between pages. The search functionality is prominently displayed, and detailed pages for movies and people present rich, well-organized information. The ability to view other users' profiles encourages social interaction and adds a community aspect to the app.

## Future Enhancements

While MovieGeek is fully functional, there are several potential features to implement:
- **Movie Reviews and Ratings**: Allow users to leave reviews or ratings for movies.
- **Recommendation System**: Build a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on user preferences.
- **Social Sharing**: Allow users to share their favorite movies on social media platforms.

## Conclusion

MovieGeek is a fun and interactive web application for movie lovers. It provides users with the ability to explore movies, save their favorites, and manage personal profiles. Built using Flask, SQLite3, and the TMDB API, the project showcases web development skills with a focus on user-friendly design and API integration. This project serves as a solid foundation for further development in web applications and external API usage.
